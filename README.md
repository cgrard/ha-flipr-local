A **100% local integration for Home Assistant** that turns your Flipr analyzer into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sensor, allowing you to monitor and control your pool without any cloud dependency. 🛡️

> ⚠️ **Warning**: This integration directly polls the Flipr over Bluetooth. If you use the official Wi-Fi gateway alongside it, rigorous sync mode management is built-in to prevent battery drain.

### 💡 Why this integration?
As the company CTAC-TECH / Flipr is undergoing liquidation, access to their cloud servers has become uncertain. **Flipr Local** is the result of extensive **Reverse Engineering** to transform your analyzer into a reliable local industrial sensor, capable of communicating directly with your Home Assistant instance.
Flipr Local lets you replace the cloud with a **local control** solution, providing robust **pool monitoring** based on a **BLE sensor**.

---

### ✅ Compatibility
* 🏷️ **Supported Models**: Flipr AnalysR (All Bluetooth versions - with or without a subscription).
* 🌐 **Flexible Usage**: Works with or without the Flipr Connect Wi-Fi gateway.
* 🏅 **Tested on**: Validated with **Flipr AnalysR 3** and **Flipr Start Max**.
* 🛠️ **Required Hardware**: Internal Bluetooth, USB Bluetooth dongle, or **ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy** (Highly recommended, [easy installation here](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/)).
* 📶 **Signal Quality**: A stable **RSSI signal (ideally above -75 dBm)** is critical to ensure connection to the Flipr. Testing shows that signals below **-80 dBm** can cause frequent failures.
* ⏱️ **Real-time Monitoring**: A `sensor.*_bluetooth_signal` entity, using passive listening in Home Assistant, lets you monitor the signal strength in real-time without draining the probe's battery!

> ❌ **Not Compatible**: Versions that operate exclusively via the Sigfox network are not supported.

### 🚀 Installation

#### Via HACS (Recommended)
As this repository is not (yet) in the official default list, you must add it as a custom repository.

1. Open **HACS** in Home Assistant.
2. Click the 3 dots in the top right corner and select **Custom repositories**.
3. In **Repository**, paste the URL: `https://github.com/Adrien40/ha-flipr-local`
4. In **Type**, choose **Integration**, then click **Add**.
5. Once added, a window appears: click **Download** (select the latest version).
6. **Completely restart Home Assistant**.
7. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services** > **Add Integration** and search for "Flipr Local".

### Manual
Copy the `custom_components/flipr_local` folder into the `custom_components` directory of your Home Assistant configuration, then restart.

---

### 🌐 Managing the Wi-Fi Gateway (Flipr Connect)
The integration works perfectly alongside your official setup:

* **WITHOUT Gateway**: Home Assistant wakes the Flipr according to the polling interval you selected (default: every 60 min).
* **WITH Gateway**: Configure the Flipr to **Eco Mode** (2 measures/day) or Sleep (0 measure/day) via the integration options. The official gateway handles the cloud sync, while Home Assistant reads the data locally without draining the battery.

### 🧪 Chemical Expertise: Professional-Grade Analysis

👉 No need to understand these calculations: everything is automated in Home Assistant.

<details>
<summary>🔬 View scientific details</summary>

#### 1. Active Chlorine (The true disinfection power) 🧂
The ORP (Redox) probe does not measure the quantity of chlorine (mg/L), but the **disinfection strength** of the water. This power drops significantly as the pH rises. Flipr Local cross-references your ORP and pH in real-time to provide an estimate of the **Active Chlorine** level, the only true indicator to know if your water is properly sanitizing.

#### 2. Water Balance: Langelier Saturation Index & Taylor Balance ⚖️
The Langelier Saturation Index (LSI) is the essential companion to the **Taylor Balance**. It determines if your water is:
* **Corrosive (LSI < -0.3)**: The water is eating away at your seals, liner, and metals.
* **Balanced (LSI between -0.3 and +0.3)**: Perfect water.
* **Scaling (LSI > +0.3)**: Risk of calcium deposits.

Enter your Alkalinity (TAC), Hardness (TH), and TDS in the options, and Home Assistant will calculate your balance live based on the temperature read by the Flipr!

> **Diagnostic**: The integration also exposes the raw pH (mV), the factory-calculated pH, the full hex frame, and the timestamp of the last measurement.

### 🎯 A Note on Measurement Accuracy
The values displayed in Home Assistant may differ slightly from the official Flipr app.

Flipr Local enables "high-precision" calibration. Unlike the mobile app, which uses fixed values, our integration allows you to enter the exact value of your buffer solution (pH 7.02, 4.01, etc.) adjusted for temperature during calibration. This scientific rigor may create a slight discrepancy, indicating a measurement that is closer to the reality of your pool. 🔬

---

## 🚀 Configuration
1. Go to **Settings** > **Devices & Services**.
2. The integration should automatically discover your Flipr if your Bluetooth adapter/antenna is in range.
3. Click **Add Integration** and search for **Flipr Local**.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to define the treatment type (Chlorine, Bromine) and the calibration/offset of your probes.

### ⚙️ Options, Calibrations, and Alerts
Once the device is added, you can click on **Configure** ⚙️ to:
* Adjust your calibration solution values (pH 4, pH 7, ORP).
* Modify your water parameters (TAC, TH, TDS, Stabilizer) via the dashboard.
* Define your **custom alert thresholds** (Min/Max pH, Min/Max ORP, etc.) to trigger your own automations.

> 🎛️ For a step-by-step walkthrough of probe calibration and alert thresholds, see the [Calibration Guide](docs/calibration.en.md).

### 🐛 Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary>⚠️ View common issues</summary>
  
* **Frequent Bluetooth errors**: The integration automatically handles connection retries. If the sensor shows `Signal Lost`, the Flipr is out of range. Move your antenna closer or [install an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy](https://esphome.github.io/bluetooth-proxies/) as close to the pool as possible (only requires an ESP32 (~10€) and a USB charger).
* **Free and Active Chlorine show "Unknown"**: If you selected "Bromine" in the options, this is normal behavior. Bromine is not calculated the same way as chlorine. Rely on the ORP (Redox) probe value.
* **I don't use stabilizer**: Simply set the `CyA (Stabilizer)` entity to `0`. The chemical calculation will adapt automatically.

### 🛠️ Hardware Rescue:

<details>
<summary>🔧 View the complete procedure</summary>

If your Flipr probes are dead, you can replace them yourself!

**Hardware required:**
1. Replacement probes (pH and ORP) with a BNC connector (Recommended dimensions: **12 mm diameter, 15-16 cm long**).
2. Two adapter cables (**Pigtails**): `Right-angle MMCX Male (90°) to BNC Female`. *The right-angle connector is essential to be able to close the Flipr cover.*

**Quick Procedure:**
Remove the old probes, clean the white base. Plug the MMCX adapters into the motherboard (`PH` and `ORP` ports). Pass the new probes through the original holes (12 mm), connect them to the BNC cables. Calibrate via Home Assistant, and you're good to go!

</details>

> 📡 **Recycle the WiFi gateway**: rather than buying a dedicated ESP32, you can reflash the obsolete Flipr WiFi gateway into an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy. See the full reverse-engineering guide: [Recycling the Flipr WiFi gateway into an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy](docs/esphome-proxy.en.md).
